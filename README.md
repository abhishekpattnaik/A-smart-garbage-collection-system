# A-smart-garbage-collection-system
Short description of the project:
This project is an innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. It gives a real
time indication of the garbage level present in a trashcan at any given instant of time. This
system uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bin to detect the garbage level and a weight
sensor placed at the bottom of the bin to measure the weight of the garbage. Using that data,
trucks will be categorized according to the measured weight of the garbage stored in dustbin at
different places, after that routes will be optimized and accordingly the trucks will be directed
to go to the places where the garbage cans will be filled i.e. which are required to be evacuated
immediately, rather than wandering all over the places for the filled cans. This could result to
less fuel consumption as well as less time consumption process. Likewise It allows trash
collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule.
Aim/Objective of the project:
The smart trash bin will fetch data using the sensors (ultrasonic sensor and weight sensor) in it
and will forward the data to the cloud using a microcontroller.
Methodology :
So here we have replaced the manual system by introducing the concept of automation, which
provides more benefit and accurate information time to time. The process is: -
• bin collects the data with the use of ultra-sonic sensor and weight sensor.
• this information is collected through Wi-Fi and then sent to the cloud for processing
through a microcontroller(Raspberry pi).
• An android application will be developed for data monitoring.
• According to the collected data, shortest path will be made for the truck drivers.
• Sending the vehicles for particular area to collect the trash depending on the type of
material it is segregated.

Possible outcome of the project:
In today’s busy world people are trying their best to reduce their manual effort by introducing
a new revolutionary concept so called automation, this thing helps a lot for more efficient
outcome with less time utilization. Here in this project we have the same intention to reduce
human effort and let the machines to solve our complex problems. The concept of smart
garbage can reduce human effort to a greater extent. It won’t just reduce the complexities but
it will be also useful for reducing fuel consumption as well as time consumption. This concept
is all about cleanliness which has become a serious problem in our country, so we hope this
might work well in that field as well.
Importance of the project in engineering aspect:
This project introduces us to the field of Embedded System, implementation of maps, Android
application development, automation and many such. These all fields have become one of the
most uprising technological advancement aspects. In the present generation these things have
overcome all the other traditional techniques of implementation and have enhanced the field of
advancement to a different level. So working on this field will definitely help us too learn a lot
and help us in future as well.
Innovativeness:
The smart phone application can track the trash cans and it will pin it in the map as a pickup
spot and accordingly it will find the shortest path along with the categorization. It includes
concepts of two major uprising technological fields i.e. IoT as well as smart phone application.
All together it will result to a very efficient model. This project isn’t just all about
technological advancement, its concern is also about the welfare of humans, by taking a step
towards the cleanliness of our environment. One way or other we have got a chance to support
the swach bharat abhiyan program.
